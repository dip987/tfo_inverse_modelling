    Custom Histogram:
    ----------------
    The custom histogram function minimizes the reconstruction error in exp(-L). This is the term that care about in
    the physics based loss for inverse-modeling. The custom histogram function is implemented as follows:

        1. The first bin is always between [0, 1) mm
        2. However, the first bin center is always considered at 0. This accomodates the very large distribution spike
        seen at 0. Moving the center to 0.5 introduces a very large error.
        3. The rest of the bins are logarithmically spaced between [1, max_val] mm.
        4. Any data point beyond max_val is dropped. The reason being exp(-L) for large values of L is very close to 0.
        We default to 345. This is because we ultimately care about exp(-\\mu*L) where \\mu is the absorption coefficient.
        The average value of \\mu is around 0.04 mm^-1. So, exp(-0.04*345) produces 10^-6. This is a good threshold.
